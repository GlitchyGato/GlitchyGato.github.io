            Hi, I'm Gabriel. I'm from Bogot√°, Colombia and I'm 17 years old. 
            I'm passionate about constantly pushing myself and learning new things. 
            On the year 2021, I decided to leave school and since then I've been studying with different online resources on areas of my interest. 
        </p>
        <p>
            I'm constantly in the urge to do the things right and making the best out of every situation. 
            I like to be methodical, organized and thoughtful about how I approach my daily life. 
            Although my main area of studies has been computer science, I also enjoy investigating about themes like productivity, habits, and well-being factors like training and nutrition. 
            In my free time I like watching anime, playing some great indie videogames or trying new recipes in the kitchen.
        </p>
        <p>
            I'm looking forward to finishing my high school education and eventually starting a cs major in a university.
            Right now I'm focused on continuing expanding my knowledge and finding ways to apply that knowledge.
