        <p>
            Hi, I'm Gabriel. I'm from Bogot√°, Colombia, and I'm 18 years old. 
            I'm passionate about constantly pushing myself and learning new things. 
            In the year 2021, I decided to leave school and since then I've been studying with different online resources on areas of my interest. 
        </p>
        <p>
            I'm constantly in the urge to do things right and make the best out of every situation. 
            I like to be methodical, organized, and thoughtful about everything I do. 
            Although my main area of study has been computer science, I also enjoy investigating about themes like productivity, habits, and well-being factors like training and nutrition. 
            In my free time, I like watching anime, playing some great indie video games, or trying new recipes in the kitchen.
        </p>
        <p>
            I'm looking forward to finishing my high school education and eventually starting a CS major at a university.
            Right now, my focus is on continuing to expand my knowledge and find ways to apply that knowledge. 
        </p>
